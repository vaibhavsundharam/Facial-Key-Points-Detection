# Facial-Key-Points-Detection
The objective of this task is to predict key point positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

Tracking faces in images and video

Analyzing facial expressions

Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis

Biometrics / face recognition

Detecting facial key points is a very challenging problem. Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, here is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.
