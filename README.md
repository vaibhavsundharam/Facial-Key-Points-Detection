# Facial-Key-Points-Detection
Facial Key Point Detection
The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

1. Tracking faces in images and video
2. Analysing facial expressions
3. Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
4. Biometrics / face recognition
5. Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem. Facial features ary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, here is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.
